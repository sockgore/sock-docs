Embeds are styled message components that offer greater customization options than standard messages, allowing you to modify elements such as color, title, and images.

## Creating an Embed
You can use `/server embed create` to create an embed.
<Frame> <video autoPlay muted loop src="/assets/videos/embed-create.mp4" /> </Frame>
<Tip>**Did you know?** The optional parameters give you a faster method of filling out your embed.</Tip>
The `[name]` parameter is what allows Sock to identify your embed from others. By default, names are lowercase and can't have more than 50 characters.

Click on the dropdown and click any of the options to edit.
<Info>You can use [variables](/resources/variables) to make dynamic embeds.</Info>
<Frame> <video autoPlay muted loop width="500px" src="/assets/videos/embed-menu.mp4" /> </Frame>
When clicking on an option, a form will prompt. Fill it out with what you want to edit in your embed. When finished, click on **Submit** and your changes will be saved.

You're done! You can use `/eval content:{embed:template}` to send your embed.
