Embeds are styled messages that offer more style compared to normal messages. This section will be going through on how to use our user-friendly command builder to easily create embeds.

## Creating an Embed
You can use `/server embed create` to create an embed.
<Frame> <video autoPlay muted loop src="/assets/videos/embed-create.mp4" /> </Frame>
<Tip>**Did you know?** The optional parameters give you a faster method of filling out your embed.</Tip>
The `[name]` parameter is what allows Sock to identify your embed from others. By default, names are lowercase and can't have more than 50 characters.

Click on the dropdown and click any of the options to edit. When clicking on an option, a form will prompt for you to fill out.
<Frame> <video autoPlay muted loop width="500px" src="/assets/videos/embed-menu.mp4" /> </Frame>
Click on **Submit** and you're done! You can use `/eval {embed:name}` to test your embed.
<Info> `{embed:}` is an example of a variable. Click [here](/resources/variables) to learn more about them. </Info>
