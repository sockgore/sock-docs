Embeds are styled message components that offer greater customization options than standard messages, allowing you to modify elements such as color, title, and images.

## Creating an Embed
**1.** Use `/server embed create` to create an embed.
<Frame> <video controls className="w-full aspect-video" src="/assets/videos/embed-create.mp4" /> </Frame>
<Tip>**Did you know?** The optional parameters give you a faster method of filling out your embed.</Tip>
The `[name]` parameter is what allows Sock to identify your embed from others. By default, names are lowercase and can't have more than 50 characters.

**2.** Click on the dropdown and click any of the options to edit.
<Info>For more dynamic embeds, you can use [variables](/resources/variables) in your embed.</Info>
<Frame> <img src="/assets/images/embed-menu.png" /> </Frame>
Selecting an option will prompt a form. When you're finished filling up the form, click on **Submit** and all your changes will be saved.

You're done! You can use `/eval` to send your embed.
